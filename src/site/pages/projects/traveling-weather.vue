        <p>
          While planning a trip to Europe, I came across the need to plan out
          what to pack during my two week trip through 6 different countries. It
          seemed like an issue that anyone who travels needs to deal with, so I
          set out to create a resource that makes it easy to check out the best
          time of year to visit different destinations.
          <a
            class="underline text-blue-700"
            href="https://travelingweather.com?src=isaacsite"
            target="_blank"
            >Explore the weather here.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          I did some cursory keyword research and it turns out that a lot of
          people are looking to discover this same type of weather information.
          My initial strategy targeting some of those keywords to see if I can
          get some traction and validate the idea. Down the road I plan to add a
          full blown weather planner tool to schedule out the different places
          being visited, and recommend what clothes to pack to make sure you're
          covered for each destination.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-semibold mt-6 text-xl">The Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
          The project is still under active development, but the initial roadmap
          is looking like this:
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">‚úîÔ∏è Gathering data</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          I leveraged the US government's NOAA weather data set to aggregate
          monthly weather averages for thousands of weather stations throughout
          the year and align them with nearby cities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">‚úîÔ∏è Building landing pages</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          To target some low hanging keywords, I built a variety of landing
          pages for monthly weather in popular cities.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">üïë SEO</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          Building links and improving content to boost SEO to the landing
          pages.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">üïë Planning tool</p>
        <p class="mt-1 mb-8">
          To drive engagement, I plan to build out a full planning tool to
          schedule which cities you're visiting and show the weather throughout
          the trip.
